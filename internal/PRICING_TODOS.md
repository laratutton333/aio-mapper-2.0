# Pricing page TODOs (internal)

Saved from the previous placeholder `app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx` so the public pricing page can match the new design.

- Pricing is a placeholder during UI porting. Wire billing to your existing backend when ready.
- TODO: connect billing (Starter / Team / Enterprise cards)
